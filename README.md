‚≠êThe given scenario was implemented in accordance with the request of the company, following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the Java language. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology in software development, and in this case, it was employed in Java to achieve a more modular, flexible, and maintainable code design. The principles of inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation were among the OOP concepts applied.

‚≠êAlthough the specific framework was not mentioned in the provided test cases, the tests were executed using the JUnit framework. JUnit is a widely used framework for automating unit tests of Java-based applications. Utilizing JUnit enables more organized and easily maintainable tests, as well as facilitating reusability. Additionally, the JUnit framework provides the capability to generate error reports automatically in case of failures.

‚≠êHowever, it was observed that the scenario was not strictly followed, and some modifications were made. The reasons and implications of these modifications can be elaborated in more detail. For instance, the differences between the scenario requirements and the actual implementation can be examined, explaining the rationale behind each difference and its impact. The effects of these modifications on aspects such as performance, usability, or other features can also be evaluated.

‚≠êIt was mentioned that the output was displayed on the console for convenient verification of the validation steps. However, further elaboration can be provided on the specifics of the output, including the type of information displayed and its purpose. For example, details such as the nature of test results and the identification of error causes can be specified. This enhances the debugging process and aids developers in quickly diagnosing issues.

‚≠êFurthermore, it was stated that reusable methods were created to adhere to the SOLID principles. The SOLID principles can be explained in more depth, providing a comprehensive understanding. For instance, the Single Responsibility Principle emphasizes that a class should have a single responsibility, and accordingly, classes are designed accordingly. Similarly, the Open-Closed Principle highlights the importance of making classes extensible but not modifiable. Applying these principles promotes code flexibility, maintainability, and reusability.
